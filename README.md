<p align="center"> In dealing with the different tasks of AD, the first thing we need resolve is how to find our Users, Computers or Printers etc. So we would 
                   go into User and Computers and right click on our domain, then click on "find", a box should open where you should see a drop down. The 
                   drop down will have different options of what you are trying to find whether its a person(users), computer, a printer etc. So after you 
                   have an option, let's say users, you can type in their first and last name. Then hit find now. This will automatically find the account 
                   that you are looking for. So if a user is lockout of their account and they need a password reset. You can right click on the User then go 
                   to properties. If you check the Users Account Tab, then check unlock users account and apply this should unlock the user's account.</br>
